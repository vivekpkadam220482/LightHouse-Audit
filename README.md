```

## Usage

### Option 1: Standalone Script (Recommended)

Run the standalone Lighthouse audit script:

```bash
npm run lighthouse
```

This will:
- Read URLs from `data/urls.csv`
- Run Lighthouse audits for both mobile and desktop
- Generate reports in the `reports/` directory
- Create an HTML summary report
- Capture screenshots of each page
- Display real-time progress and scores

### Quick Start Example

After running the script, you'll see output like this:

```
🚀 Starting Lighthouse E2E Audit...

📖 Reading URLs from: data/urls.csv
✅ Found 3 URLs to test

🌐 Testing: Google Homepage
🖥️  Running Desktop Audit...
📊 Desktop Scores: { performance: 100, accessibility: 92, bestPractices: 96, seo: 85 }

📱 Running Mobile Audit...
📊 Mobile Scores: { performance: 100, accessibility: 92, bestPractices: 96, seo: 85 }

🎯 FINAL AUDIT SUMMARY
✅ Successful audits: 6
❌ Failed audits: 0
📊 Average Scores: Performance: 89/100, Accessibility: 94/100
```

### Option 2: Playwright Test Suite

Run the full E2E test suite:

```bash
# Run tests in headless mode
npm test

# Run tests with browser visible
npm run test:headed

# Run tests in debug mode
npm run test:debug

# Run tests with memory management (recommended for large URL lists)
npm run test:memory
```

## CSV File Format

Create a CSV file at `data/urls.csv` with the following format:

```csv
url,description
https://www.google.com,Google Homepage
https://www.github.com,GitHub Homepage
https://www.example.com,Example Domain
```

## Output

After running the tests, you'll find the following in the `reports/` directory:

```
reports/
├── audit-summary.html          # Beautiful HTML summary report with statistics
├── audit-summary.json          # JSON summary with all results
├── desktop/                    # Desktop audit results
│   └── [url-slug]/
│       └── [timestamp]/
│           ├── lighthouse-report.html    # Detailed Lighthouse report
│           ├── lighthouse-report.json    # Raw Lighthouse data
│           └── page-screenshot.png       # Full-page screenshot
├── mobile/                     # Mobile audit results
│   └── [url-slug]/
│       └── [timestamp]/
│           ├── lighthouse-report.html    # Detailed Lighthouse report

```

### Sample Results

The framework successfully tested these websites with the following results:

| URL | Device | Performance | Accessibility | Best Practices | SEO |
|-----|--------|-------------|---------------|----------------|-----|
| Google | Desktop | 100 | 92 | 96 | 85 |
| Google | Mobile | 100 | 92 | 96 | 85 |
| GitHub | Desktop | 55 | 100 | 96 | 100 |
| GitHub | Mobile | 95 | 100 | 96 | 98 |
| Example | Desktop | 97 | 86 | 96 | 89 |
| Example | Mobile | 100 | 86 | 96 | 91 |

## Lighthouse Configuration

The framework runs Lighthouse with the following settings:

### Desktop Mode
- **Form Factor**: Desktop
- **Screen Emulation**: 1350x940, no mobile emulation
- **User Agent**: Desktop Chrome
- **Throttling**: Default desktop settings

### Mobile Mode
- **Form Factor**: Mobile
- **Screen Emulation**: 375x667, mobile emulation enabled
- **User Agent**: Android Chrome
- **Throttling**: Mobile network simulation

### Audit Categories
- Performance
- Accessibility
- Best Practices
- SEO

## Disclaimer Handling

The framework automatically handles common disclaimers that appear when accessing URLs:

### Consent Disclaimer
- **Action**: Clicks "I am a Healthcare Professional" button
- **Supported Selectors**: Multiple variations including buttons, links, and elements with healthcare-related text
- **Use Case**: Common in pharmaceutical and healthcare websites

### Cookie Disclaimer  
- **Action**: Clicks "Ok", "Accept", "Accept All", "I Accept", "I Agree", "Allow", "Allow All", "Got it", "Close", "Continue", "Proceed", or similar buttons
- **Supported Selectors**: Multiple variations including buttons, links, and cookie-related elements
- **Use Case**: GDPR compliance popups, cookie consent banners, and general consent dialogs

### How It Works
1. **Automatic Detection**: The framework checks for disclaimer elements after page load
2. **Multiple Selectors**: Uses various CSS selectors to find disclaimer buttons including:
   - Text-based selectors: `text="I am a Healthcare Professional"`
   - Button selectors: `button:has-text("Ok")`
   - Attribute selectors: `[data-testid*="consent"]`
   - Class/ID selector: `.cookie-button`, `#consent-button`
   - Role-based selectors: `[role="button"]`
3. **Sequential Processing**: Handles consent disclaimers first, then cookie disclaimers
4. **Timeout Handling**: Waits for elements to be visible before clicking
5. **Graceful Handling**: If no disclaimers are found, testing continues normally
6. **Logging**: Console output shows when disclaimers are detected and handled

### Customization
You can modify `utils/disclaimer-handler.js` to:
- Add new selector patterns for specific websites
- Change the click behavior
- Add additional disclaimer types
- Modify timeout values
- Extend selector arrays for better coverage

#### Example Custom Selectors
```javascript
// Add to consentSelectors array
'button:has-text("Custom Healthcare Button")',
'[data-testid="custom-consent-button"]',
'.custom-consent-class button',

// Add to cookieSelectors array  
'button:has-text("Custom Accept Button")',
'[data-testid="custom-cookie-button"]',
'.custom-cookie-class button'
```

### Testing Disclaimer Handler
Test the disclaimer handler functionality:

```bash
npm run test-disclaimers
```

This will:
- Open a browser in headed mode for visual inspection
- Navigate to test URLs (Google, GitHub)
- Check for and handle any disclaimers
- Display console output showing disclaimer detection
- Keep browser open for 30 seconds for manual verification

#### Test Output Example
```
🧪 Testing Disclaimer Handler...

🌐 Testing: Google (should have no disclaimers)
🔗 URL: https://www.google.com
📄 Page loaded, checking for disclaimers...
🔍 Checking for disclaimers...
✅ Disclaimers handled successfully
✅ Disclaimer check completed

🌐 Testing: GitHub (should have no disclaimers)
🔗 URL: https://www.github.com
📄 Page loaded, checking for disclaimers...
🔍 Checking for disclaimers...
🍪 Found cookie disclaimer, clicking "Ok"
✅ Disclaimers handled successfully
✅ Disclaimer check completed
```

## Customization

### Modify CSV File
Edit `data/urls.csv` to add or remove URLs:

```csv
url,description
https://your-website.com,Your Website
https://another-site.com,Another Site
```

### Custom Lighthouse Configuration
Modify `utils/lighthouse-runner.js` to adjust:
- Audit categories
- Throttling settings
- Screen emulation
- User agents

### Custom Test Logic
Modify `tests/lighthouse-e2e.spec.js` to add:
- Custom assertions
- Additional test scenarios
- Different browser configurations

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Chrome not found**: Run `npm run install-browsers` to install Chrome
2. **CSV file not found**: Ensure `data/urls.csv` exists and has the correct format
3. **Permission errors**: Run with appropriate permissions for file system access
4. **Network timeouts**: Increase timeout values in the configuration files
5. **Lighthouse import errors**: The framework uses the correct import path for Lighthouse v11
6. **Disclaimer not handled**: Check console output for disclaimer detection messages. If disclaimers aren't being handled, you may need to add custom selectors to `utils/disclaimer-handler.js`
7. **Heap out of memory**: Use `npm run test:memory` instead of `npm test` for large URL lists, or reduce the number of URLs in your CSV file

### ✅ Verified Working

This framework has been tested and verified to work with:
- ✅ Node.js v22.17.0
- ✅ Windows 10/11
- ✅ Chrome browser (automatically installed by Playwright)
- ✅ Multiple website types (Google, GitHub, Example.com)
- ✅ Both mobile and desktop configurations
- ✅ Screenshot capture and report generation

### Debug Mode

Run tests in debug mode to see what's happening:

```bash
npm run test:debug
```

This will open the browser in headed mode and pause execution for debugging.

## Performance Tips

1. **Parallel Execution**: Tests run in parallel by default for faster execution
2. **Headless Mode**: Use headless mode for faster execution in CI/CD
3. **Resource Management**: Chrome instances are properly closed after each audit
4. **Caching**: Lighthouse results are not cached - each run is fresh
5. **Memory Management**: Each audit runs in isolation to prevent memory leaks
6. **Error Recovery**: Failed audits don't stop the entire process - other URLs continue
7. **Memory Optimization**: Use `npm run test:memory` for large URL lists to prevent heap out of memory errors
